# Self-Supervised-BERT-Transformer-for-Android-Malware-Detection-and-Categorization

With the rise of Android-based smartphones and tablets, the number of malicious applications targeting these devices has also increased significantly. As a result, there is a pressing need for effective methods to detect and categorize Android malware. Despite the existence of numerous android malware families, categorizing android malware into specific classes has proven to be a daunting task. The complexity of android malware and the varying techniques employed by attackers make it challenging to accurately label and classify malware. Moreover, the sheer volume of android malware variants makes it challenging for researchers to keep up with the latest threats and accurately label them. In addition, the lack of a standard classification system for Android malware also adds to the difficulty in categorizing and comparing different malware families. These factors have resulted in a significant gap in our understanding of android malware and the risks it poses to mobile security. For this reason, beyond collecting benign APKs for detection, we have retrieved the association between families and categories made by MADAM to build the categorization model. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to Android malware analysis that leverages the power of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to detect and categorize malware. BERT is a state-of-the-art language model that has shown impressive results in a wide range of natural language processing tasks. BERT is one of the best model to use in order to detect and categorize malware in Android since it has the ability to understand the context of a sequence of words and the ability to handle long sequences and capture the relationships between them, which is necessary for representing the behavior of malware. We have employed BERT to classify sequences of Android API calls, extracted from API Call Graphs, in order to identify patterns of behavior that are indicative of different malicious activities, and so different malware categories. We have decided to carry out our analysis on 3 different malware categories which covered more than 90% of the benchmarking dataset, which are SMS-Trojan, Rootkit and Spyware. By applying BERT to the field of Android malware analysis, we have developed a method for detecting and categorizing malware, which achieves 98% of accuracy on detection and 94% of accuracy on categorization.
